Have you ever felt like the boot-up time of the SQL server was too long? Or, if you were using SQL Availability Group and needed to failover to another node for maintenance tasks, did it also take too long to finish, causing downtime? I do! I want to understand why. (Yeah, always asking why!)

Let's first understand the recovery process of the SQL server. This process occurs when the server crashes (or you perform a reboot action) or when you execute a failover.

Well, there are so many definitions here that need to be understood before going deeper. Let's break it down!

- **Logging**: Every transaction that hits the SQL server will be logged into the transaction log file before saving into the database file. Why? (See you in the next post!)
- **Committed transaction**: It's just as simple as it sounds. BEGIN TRANSACTION ... COMMIT TRANSACTION.
- **Uncommitted transaction**: Yeah, simple again. BEGIN TRANSACTION ... (and then the crash or failover happened).
- **Dirty data/page**: The SQL engine does not interact with the data on disk directly. When it needs to read/change the data, it will first pull the data into memory and then read/write on that. The changed data in memory is called dirty data, and it will need to be written back to disk to persist. The process of writing the data back to disk from memory is called a checkpoint.
 
Now, here is a summary of the recovery process:
1. **Analysis**: This is the process where the SQL server will analyze the current status of the server/database to decide the appropriate next steps. What does it do?
    - First, from the last checkpoint, it will read forward to determine the state of each transaction:
        - Committed transactions not yet written to disk => redo (persist to disk).
        - Uncommitted transactions => undo (revert the changes).
2. **Redo**: Starting from the oldest uncommitted transaction, it reads forward to the end of the log and commits any transactions that were committed to the log but not the database file.
3. **Undo**: It starts from the end of the log, reads backward, and rolls back any transactions that were still open or weren't committed to the log.

hmm, So what is the limitation of this process ? Well, continue reading
