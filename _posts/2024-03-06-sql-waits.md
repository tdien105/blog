# SQL Server Wait Stats

Mapping between performance counter and SQL Server wait type.

* **Lock waits** - `LCK_M_*`

    Lock waits occur when a query is waiting for a lock to be released by another transaction. Locks are used to ensure the consistency of data. SQL Server has various lock types (e.g., Shared, Exclusive), and the `LCK_M_*` prefix indicates different lock modes such as:

    * **`LCK_M_S`**: Shared lock
    * **`LCK_M_X`**: Exclusive lock
    * **`LCK_M_U`**: Update lock

    **Examples of scenarios:**
    * A read operation is waiting for a write lock to be released (`LCK_M_S`).
    * A write operation is waiting for another write lock to be released (`LCK_M_X`).

* **Log buffer waits** - `LOGBUFFER`

    This wait type occurs when a session is waiting for space to become available in the log buffer to write log records. The log buffer is a memory area where SQL Server stores transaction log records before writing them to disk.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Heavy transactional workloads causing the log buffer to fill up faster than it can be written to disk.

* **Log write waits** - `WRITELOG`

    This wait type occurs when a session is waiting for the log manager to write log records to disk. It indicates the time spent waiting for the transaction log to be flushed to disk.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Disk I/O contention or slow disk subsystems impacting log write performance.

* **Memory grant queue waits** - `RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE`

    This wait type occurs when a query is waiting for sufficient memory to execute. SQL Server uses memory grants for operations such as sorts and hash joins.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Insufficient memory available for query execution due to high memory usage by other processes or large queries.

* **Network IO waits** - `NET_WAITFOR_PACKET`

    This wait type occurs when SQL Server is waiting for a network packet to be sent or received. It can be related to network latency or throughput issues.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Network latency or slow network connections impacting data transmission.

* **Non-Page latch waits** - `LATCH_*`

    These waits occur for internal memory structures and synchronization objects not related to disk I/O. Latches are lightweight synchronization objects used to protect internal data structures.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Contention on internal memory structures, such as data buffers or internal caches.

* **Page IO latch waits** - `PAGEIOLATCH_*`

    These waits occur when SQL Server is waiting for a data page to be read from disk into memory. This can indicate disk I/O bottlenecks.

    **Examples:**
    * **`PAGEIOLATCH_SH`**: Waiting for a page to be read into memory for a shared latch.
    * **`PAGEIOLATCH_EX`**: Waiting for a page to be read into memory for an exclusive latch.

* **Page latch waits** - `PAGELATCH_*`

    These waits occur for latch operations on in-memory pages. Unlike page I/O latches, these do not involve disk reads.

    **Examples:**
    * **`PAGELATCH_SH`**: Waiting for a shared latch on an in-memory page.
    * **`PAGELATCH_EX`**: Waiting for an exclusive latch on an in-memory page.

* **Thread-safe memory objects waits** - `SOS_MEMORY_TOPLEVELBLOCKALLOCATOR`

    This wait type occurs when threads are waiting for memory allocation using the SOS (SQL Operating System) memory allocator.

    **Typical cause:**
    * High contention on memory allocation for thread-safe memory objects.

* **Transaction ownership waits** - `XACT_OWNERSHIP`

    This wait type occurs when a session is waiting to acquire ownership of a transaction. This can happen during activities like distributed transactions.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Contention on transaction objects or coordination of distributed transactions.

* **Wait for the worker** - `THREADPOOL`

    This wait type occurs when there are no worker threads available to execute tasks. SQL Server uses a pool of worker threads to handle user requests.

    **Typical cause:**
    * All worker threads are busy, typically due to a high number of concurrent requests or long-running queries.

* **Workspace synchronization waits** - `EXECSYNC`

    This wait type occurs when a session is waiting for synchronization of the execution workspace. This can involve coordination between different parts of the query execution process.

    **Typical cause:**
    * Synchronization issues between execution tasks, such as parallel query execution coordination.
